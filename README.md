# MongoDB-MCP 🔄

**AI-Powered Database Management. Zero Code Required.**  
```bash
# Connect Claude to MongoDB with natural language
```

## Demo Video 🎬

See how easy it is to manage your MongoDB database with just natural language prompts through Claude!

## What's This All About? 🚀  
MongoDB-MCP is a powerful bridge between Claude AI and MongoDB databases. This custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enables seamless CRUD operations directly through conversational prompts. No more context switching between your AI assistant and database tools—just ask Claude what you need, and watch it happen.

### Why It's Cool 😎  
- **Conversational Database Management**: Query, insert, update, and delete with natural language.  
- **Node.js Backend**: Lightweight, efficient server that connects Claude to MongoDB.  
- **Function Calling Integration**: Leverages Claude's tools API for precise database operations.  
- **Zero-Code Interface**: Perfect for both developers and non-technical users.  
- **Real-time Results**: See database changes instantly within your Claude conversation.  

## What I've Mastered 🛠️  
Building MongoDB-MCP expanded my technical toolkit:  
- Implementing Model Context Protocol for AI-to-database communication.  
- Creating custom tools for Claude using Anthropic's function calling API.  
- Designing an intuitive interface between natural language and database operations.  
- Building robust error handling for database interactions.  
- Optimizing Node.js performance for real-time database operations.

## How It Works 🔍
1. **Claude Desktop** sends function calls to the local Node.js server.
2. The **MCP Server** translates these calls into MongoDB operations.
3. **MongoDB** executes the queries and returns results.
4. **Claude** presents the data in a conversational format.

## Features ✨
- **Collection Management**: Create, list, and modify database collections.
- **Document Operations**: Insert, query, update, and delete documents with natural language.
- **Query Building**: Construct complex MongoDB queries through conversation.
- **Error Handling**: Friendly error messages that explain what went wrong.
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new database operations as needed.

## Built With 🔥  
- **Node.js**: The server-side runtime.  
- **MongoDB**: Document database for flexible data storage.  
- **Claude AI**: Anthropic's language model with function calling capabilities.  
- **Express**: Web framework for the API endpoints.
- **Model Context Protocol**: Framework for AI-to-tool communication.

## Getting Started 🚀
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tjonty/mongodb-mcp.git

# Install dependencies
cd mongodb-mcp
npm install

# Start the local server
npm start

# Connect Claude Desktop to the local endpoint
# (See documentation for detailed instructions)
```

## Future Plans 🔮
- Data visualization capabilities directly in Claude responses.
- Schema validation and suggestions.
- Advanced query builder with aggregation pipeline support.
- User authentication and multi-database support.
- Integration with additional database systems beyond MongoDB.
